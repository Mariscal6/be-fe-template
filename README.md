# Hey, what's up!

## 1. Create API Endpoint with Custom Pagination

Use the Rick and Morty client `github.com/pitakill/rickandmortyapigowrapper` to create an API that returns a list of characters.

Steps:
- Fetch data from the function `GetCharacters`
- By default, the Rick and Morty API returns 20 results per page. To return 40 results, combine data from two consecutive pages of the Rick and Morty API.
- Implement custom pagination logic to support pages of size 40.
- Expose it through the router

## 2. Create Table Component Using Fetched Data

Create a table component to display the characters mention above. Use your favourite framework.

Steps:
- Get the data from the previously created API. Make port public so there is no access errors.
- Table component
- Add all cool features you want!
